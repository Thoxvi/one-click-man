unpack-trees.c: verify_uptodate: remove dead code
Use PATH_MAX instead of TEMPFILE_PATH_LEN
Specifying --detect-branches is now only needed for the initial clone/sync. Afterwards it's turned on implicitly if more p4 branches than remotes/p4/master are found.
branch: fix segfault when resolving an invalid HEAD
Added support for git-p4 submit --direct (experimental)
Use git format-patch and git apply --apply when extracting patches from git and applying them to a Perforce checkout. This should make it possible to apply git commits with binary files that cannot be handled by path.
Oops, not only /set/ gitdir on clone, also set it /correctly/ :)
Fix gitdir not being set when cloning. Needed for writing the p4 users cache.

git-gui: Gracefully handle bad TCL_PATH at compile time

Added support for git-p4 sync/rebase --with-origin. See git-p4.txt for details :)
Bite the bullet and automatically convert old style refs/heads/p4 repositories to the new style refs/remotes/p4 branching.
Changed the default p4 import branch to be refs/remotes/p4/{HEAD,master} instead of refs/heads/p4.
Create the origin based import branch using git update-ref instead of git branch so that it's possible to have the import branch in refs/remotes.
Removed ancient and unused code to find the last imported revision from previous imports to use for the current import by looking at the p4 tags. The current approach of using the log message works better.
Removed cleantags command. It doesn't have any meaning anymore.
Clean up code duplication for revision parsing and fix previous commit to not import into remotes/p4 (yet!).
Always pass a sha1 for the initial parent so that git-fast-import doesn't think it's creating a new branch from itself. It's a sensible error in general but in the case of incremental imports we have to apply force :)
